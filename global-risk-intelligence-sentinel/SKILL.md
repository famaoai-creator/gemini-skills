# Global Risk Intelligence Sentinel

This skill connects the digital project to the real-world environment, ensuring resilience against external shocks.

## Capabilities

### 1. External Threat Monitoring
- Analyzes news and status feeds for AWS/Azure/GCP regional issues, geopolitical conflicts, or sudden changes in local laws (e.g., new data privacy bans).

### 2. Impact Assessment
- Maps real-world risks to specific project components (e.g., "AWS us-east-1 outage impacts our primary database").
- Proposes immediate mitigation steps (e.g., "Switch to secondary region us-west-2").

## Usage
- "Is there any current global risk that could impact our deployment in Southeast Asia?"
- "Audit our vendor dependencies against recent regulatory shifts in the EU."
