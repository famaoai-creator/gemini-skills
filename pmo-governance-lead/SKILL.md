# PMO Governance Lead

This skill acts as the project's internal regulator and strategic advisor.

## Capabilities

### 1. Quality Gate Enforcement
- Audits if a phase (e.g., Design) is truly complete before implementation begins.
- Checks for required evidence logs (Review feedbacks, Test results).

### 2. Risk Orchestration
- Analyzes logs from all other skills to detect "hidden" project risks (e.g., tech debt spikes, compliance gaps).
- Refers to `knowledge/pmo/standards/governance.md`.

## Usage
- "Perform a PMO audit on the current project status and identify any missing quality gates."
- "Are we ready to move from Design to Implementation? Review all design review logs."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`.
