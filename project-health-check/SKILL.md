# Project Health Check

## Overview
This skill evaluates a project's adherence to both modern engineering practices and traditional quality standards.

### 1. Structural & SDLC Audit
- **Waterfall Compliance**: Checks for phase-gate deliverables (RD, Design, Test Plans) defined in `knowledge/sdlc/waterfall_standard.md`.
- **Modern Standards**: Audits CI/CD, Testing frameworks, Linting, IaC, and Docs.

### 2. Quantitative Quality Audit
- **Metrics Evaluation**: Compares test and bug densities against IPA benchmarks in `knowledge/quality-management/metrics_standards.md`.
- **Health Scoring**: Provides a cumulative score (0-100) with prioritized improvement suggestions.

## Usage

Run the audit script from the root of the project you want to check.

```bash
node project-health-check/scripts/audit.cjs
```

## Interpretation
- **PASS**: The criterion is met.
- **WARN**: Partial compliance (e.g., bug density too low compared to test count).
- **FAIL**: Critical standard or required SDLC deliverable missing.

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
