# Localization Maestro

This skill ensures your application is truly global, not just translated.

## Capabilities

### 1. i18n Automation
- Synchronizes translation files across multiple languages.
- Detects hardcoded strings and migrates them to resource files.

### 2. Cultural & Regional Audit
- Checks for appropriate date/time formats and currency symbols.
- Flags culturally insensitive terms or symbols based on the target region.

## Usage
- "Audit the `i18n/` files for completeness and check for culturally sensitive content in the Japanese version."
- "Extract all hardcoded strings in `src/pages` and move them to `en.json`."
