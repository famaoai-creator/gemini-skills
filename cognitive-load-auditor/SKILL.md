This skill optimizes for the "Human Interface" by ensuring complexity stays within manageable limits.

## Capabilities

- Suggests refactoring based on chunking and information hierarchy.

### 2. User Cognitive Load
- Analyzes UI density and decision points in screenshots.
- Flags "Choice Overload" or confusing navigation paths.

## Usage
