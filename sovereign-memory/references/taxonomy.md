# Memory Taxonomy & Tier Guide

This guide helps you decide how to categorize facts and which tier to store them in.

## Selecting a Tier

| Tier | When to use | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **personal** | Information unique to you or highly private. | Personal habits, private tool paths, non-work preferences. |
| **confidential** | Professional facts about your company or clients. | **Project/Solution names (IB, TrustID)**, internal team names, deadlines. |
| **public** | Facts that are safe to share broadly or generic in nature. | Standard coding patterns, public documentation links, general tech tips. |

## Standard Categories

- `user_preference`: Interaction style, preferred tools.
- `project_context`: Project-specific data, timelines, stakeholders.
- `technical_decision`: Technology choices, architectural rationale.
- `workflow_rule`: Required operational steps, security constraints.
- `entity_knowledge`: Facts about organizations or teams.
