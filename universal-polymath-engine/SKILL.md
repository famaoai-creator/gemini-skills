# Universal Polymath Engine

This skill breaks the silos of computer science by applying principles from the "Universal Knowledge Base" to software engineering.

## Capabilities

### 1. Cross-Disciplinary Analogy
- Applies concepts like **Natural Selection** (to code evolution), **Thermodynamics** (to system stability), or **Game Theory** (to distributed consensus).
- Provides radical new perspectives on stubborn technical problems.

### 2. Biomimetic & Physical Modeling
- Proposes architectural patterns inspired by biological immune systems or physical structures for extreme resilience and efficiency.

## Usage
- "How can we apply principles of 'Homeostasis' to our self-healing microservices?"
- "Use game theory to analyze potential deadlock scenarios in our new locking mechanism."
