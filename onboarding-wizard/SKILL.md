# Onboarding Wizard

This skill reduces the "time-to-productivity" for new developers or contributors.

## Capabilities

### 1. Project Orientation
- Generates a "First Steps" guide including local setup, key directories, and architecture.
- Explains which Gemini skills are most relevant for the current project.

### 2. Contextual Learning
- Identifies "Good First Issues" or logical starting points in the codebase.
- Maps domain-specific glossaries to code modules.

## Usage
- "I'm new to this project. Run the `onboarding-wizard` to get me started."
- "Generate a day-one guide for a new frontend developer joining this repo."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
