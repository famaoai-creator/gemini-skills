# UX Auditor

This skill acts as a visual consultant to ensure your application is accessible and user-friendly.

## Capabilities

### 1. Visual Heuristics
- Analyzes screenshots (captured via `browser-navigator`) for layout consistency and hierarchy.
- Recommends improvements based on Nielsen Norman Group's usability heuristics.

### 2. Accessibility Check
- Estimates color contrast ratios from visual data.
- Checks for obvious accessibility issues (e.g., missing labels, small touch targets).

## Usage
- "Analyze this screenshot of the login page and provide 3 UX improvement suggestions."
- "Audit the accessibility of the homepage based on current WCAG standards."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
