# Creator's Mentor

This skill is designed to help *you* become a better engineer by reflecting on your unique journey and patterns.

## Capabilities

### 1. Pattern Reflection
- Identifies your "Signature Moves" (favorite design patterns) and your "Blind Spots" (common recurring bugs or ignored edge cases).
- Suggests personalized learning resources based on the current gaps in your repo.

### 2. Strategic Coaching
- Provides high-level architectural advice that matches your personal growth goals.
- Acts as a sounding board for your most ambitious ideas.

## Usage
- "Review my coding patterns from the last month and tell me where I can improve."
- "I want to learn more about distributed systems; what parts of this project should I focus on first?"
