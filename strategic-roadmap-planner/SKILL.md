# Strategic Roadmap Planner

This skill helps engineering leaders prioritize high-impact architectural and feature work.

## Capabilities

### 1. Technical Debt Valuation
- Analyzes the codebase to quantify technical debt and its impact on development velocity.
- Identifies "high-risk" areas that require immediate refactoring.

### 2. Roadmap Generation
- Proposes a prioritized list of tasks (e.g., "Migrate to Serverless", "Implement Micro-frontends") based on current trends and internal state.
- Justifies each task with expected business outcomes.

## Usage
- "Based on our current technical debt and modern trends, generate a 3-month engineering roadmap."
- "What should be our top 3 technical priorities for the next quarter?"

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
