# Strategic Roadmap Planner

This skill helps engineering leaders prioritize high-impact architectural and feature work.

## Capabilities

### 1. Technical Debt Valuation
- Calculates the "Interest Rate" of current legacy code.
- Uses **ECC Architect Principles** (`knowledge/external-wisdom/everything-claude/agents/architect.md`) to evaluate system design against SOLID/DRY standards.

### 2. Roadmap Generation
- Proposes a 3-month strategic plan (Gantt Chart).

## Usage
- "Based on our current technical debt and modern trends, generate a 3-month engineering roadmap."
- "What should be our top 3 technical priorities for the next quarter?"

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
