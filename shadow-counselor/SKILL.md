# Shadow Counselor

This skill is your "Daemon of Critical Thinking." It works while you sleep.

## Capabilities

### 1. Retroactive Simulation
- Takes the day's major decisions (e.g., "Adopted library X") and runs counter-factual simulations using `scenario-multiverse-orchestrator`.
- "What if Library X is deprecated next year?" "What if traffic spikes 10x?"

### 2. The Morning Briefing
- Generates a report for the next login: "Yesterday's decision seemed sound, but I found a 5% edge case risk. Here is a mitigation plan."

## Usage
- "Run a shadow analysis on our decision to migrate to Kubernetes."
- "What did you find while I was sleeping?"

## Knowledge Protocol
- Operates on a copy of the context to avoid interfering with active tasks.
