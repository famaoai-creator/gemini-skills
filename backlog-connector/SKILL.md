# Backlog Connector

This skill automates interactions with the Backlog API using credentials stored in the Personal/Confidential tiers.

## Usage

- "Use `backlog-connector` to fetch all issues from NBS_INCIDENT."
- "Get the user list from the project."

## Knowledge Protocol

- Reads `knowledge/personal/connections/backlog.md` for API Key.
- Reads `knowledge/confidential/connections/inventory.json` for Project ID mapping.
