# Technology Porter

This skill handles the ultimate technical debt: entire stack migrations.

## Capabilities

### 1. Cross-Language Migration
- Translates core logic between languages (e.g., Python to Rust) while maintaining unit test equivalence.
- Adapts code to the target language's best practices and idioms.

### 2. Equivalency Testing
- Automatically generates comparison tests to ensure the new implementation behaves exactly like the old one.

## Usage
- "Migrate the core processing module from legacy C++ to idiomatic Rust."
- "Port our backend utilities from JavaScript to Go, ensuring all edge cases are preserved."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
