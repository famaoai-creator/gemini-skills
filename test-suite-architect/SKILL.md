# Test Suite Architect

This skill automates the creation of test implementations, bridging the gap between test planning and execution.

## Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Framework Code Generation
- Generates ready-to-run test files for:
    - **Frontend**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress/Playwright.
    - **Backend**: Pytest, Supertest, Mocha/Chai.
- Maps `test-viewpoint-analyst` outputs directly to test cases.

### 2. TDD Orchestration
- Generates failing tests first based on new requirements to guide the implementation phase.

## Usage
- "Generate a Jest test suite for the user authentication logic described in `work/rd.md`."
- "Create Cypress E2E tests based on the TIS functional test viewpoints."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
