# License Auditor

This skill ensures your project is legally sound by auditing the licenses of all third-party libraries.

## Capabilities

### 1. Compliance Scan
- Lists all licenses found in `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.
- Flags restrictive (copyleft) licenses that might conflict with commercial use.

### 2. Attribution Management
- Automatically generates a `NOTICE` or `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES` file containing all required legal notices and copyrights.

## Usage
- "Audit the licenses in this project and generate a compliance report."
- "Create a NOTICE file for the upcoming release."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
