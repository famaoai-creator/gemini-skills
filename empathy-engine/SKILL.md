# Empathy Engine

This skill adds emotional intelligence to the engineering process by understanding the human feelings behind user feedback.

## Capabilities

### 1. Emotional Pulse Analysis
- Analyzes support tickets, App Store reviews, and social media mentions to identify common "Pain Points" and "Joy Points."
- Visualizes the "Emotional Lifecycle" of a user feature.

### 2. Empathy-Driven Prioritization
- Recommends task priority based on "Relieving Frustration" or "Delivering Delight," complementing purely technical or business metrics.

## Usage
- "What is the emotional impact of the recent performance slowdown on our users?"
- "Identify the feature that users are most 'grateful' for and suggest ways to enhance that feeling."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
