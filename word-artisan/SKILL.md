# Word Artisan

Generate professional, comprehensive Word documents (.docx) from Markdown.

## Documentation Fidelity Modes

1.  **Executive Summary**: Focus on high-level goals, budget, and impact.
2.  **Standard Specification**: Balanced view of functional and non-functional requirements.
3.  **Comprehensive Deep-Dive**: Exhaustive technical documentation including every parameter, CLI command, and edge case. Essential for NFR definitions and security audits.

## High-Fidelity Documentation Workflow
1.  **Standard Alignment**: Choose the appropriate standard (e.g., IPA Grade) based on the target fidelity.
2.  **Detail-Oriented Writing**: For Deep-Dive mode, expand sections with specific technical configurations.
3.  **Visual Styling**: Apply professional templates consistently.

## Usage

## Knowledge Protocol
