# Binary Archaeologist

This skill shines a light into the "dark corners" of your system where source code is missing.

## Capabilities

### 1. Reverse Engineering Support
- Analyzes compiled binaries and libraries to map their function calls and data structures.
- Identifies security risks and hidden dependencies in legacy "black boxes."

### 2. Wrapper Generation
- Generates modern API wrappers or documentation for legacy executables to make them safe to use in new microservices.

## Usage
- "Analyze this legacy `engine.bin` file and document its input/output parameters."
- "Reverse engineer the logic of this third-party library to check for hidden telemetry."
