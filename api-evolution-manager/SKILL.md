# API Evolution Manager

This skill ensures that your API grows gracefully without breaking downstream consumers.

## Capabilities

### 1. Breaking Change Detection
- Compares current API schemas (OpenAPI, GraphQL) with previous versions.
- Flags any changes that would break backward compatibility.

### 2. Lifecycle Management
- Manages deprecation notices and sunsetting schedules.
- Automatically generates "Migration Guides" for developers using the API.

## Usage
- "Audit the latest API changes for breaking changes and update the versioning plan."
- "Generate a migration guide for clients moving from v1.0 to v2.0."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
