# Kill-Switch Guardian

This skill is the ultimate guarantor of human control over the AI ecosystem.

## Capabilities

### 1. Emergency Freeze
- Immediately halts all running AI skills and background processes initiated by `mission-control`.
- Revokes temporary write permissions for autonomous agents.

### 2. Verified Rollback
- Provides an authenticated path for a human lead to revert all AI-generated changes to the last known "Human-Certified" safe state.

## Usage
- "ACTIVATE KILL-SWITCH: Freeze all AI activity and revert the last 3 autonomous commits."
- "Verify the integrity of the kill-switch protocol."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
