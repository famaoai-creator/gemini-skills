# North Star Guardian

This skill acts as the project's moral and strategic compass, ensuring every line of code serves the fundamental purpose of the product.

## Capabilities

### 1. Mission Alignment Audit
- Evaluates new feature requests and architectural proposals against the project's defined mission statement.
- Identifies "Distraction Features" that do not contribute to long-term strategic goals.

### 2. Strategic Reminders
- Periodically reminds the team of the "North Star" metrics and goals during `mission-control` or `strategic-roadmap-planner` executions.

## Usage
- "Does this proposed microservices migration align with our 'Simplicity First' North Star?"
- "Audit the current feature backlog and flag items that deviate from our core mission."
