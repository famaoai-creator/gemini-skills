# Telemetry Insight Engine

This skill closes the loop between production usage and new feature development.

## Capabilities

### 1. Usage Analysis
- Analyzes application logs and telemetry (e.g., event data) to identify underused features or common drop-off points.
- Correlates usage patterns with specific code modules.

### 2. Feedback Loop
- Automatically drafts new "Enhancement Requirements" for the `requirements-wizard` based on observed user behavior.

## Usage
- "Analyze our production telemetry and tell me which 3 features should be prioritized for improvement."
- "Are users struggling with the new checkout flow? Use `telemetry-insight-engine` to find out."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
