# Aesthetic Elegance Auditor

This skill looks beyond functional correctness to evaluate the "Soul" of the code through the lens of mathematical and structural elegance.

## Capabilities

### 1. Elegance Scoring
- Evaluates code based on principles of symmetry, minimal entropy, and expressive power.
- Identifies "clunky" but correct logic that could be expressed more beautifully.

### 2. Masterpiece Refactoring
- Suggests transformations that elevate "Good" code to "Masterpiece" level—code that is as satisfying to read as a well-composed poem or a mathematical proof.

## Usage
- "Audit the `core/algorithm.js` for aesthetic elegance and suggest refinements."
- "Elevate this implementation to its most elegant and concise form."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
