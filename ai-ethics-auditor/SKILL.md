# AI Ethics Auditor

This skill protects your organization by ensuring AI implementations are fair, unbiased, and respect user privacy.

## Capabilities

### 1. Bias & Fairness Audit
- Analyzes prompts for stereotypical or discriminatory language.
- Checks if datasets contain historical biases that could lead to unfair AI decisions.

### 2. AI Safety Verification
- Verifies that PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is not leaked through AI responses.
- Audits for "dark patterns" in AI-driven user interactions.

## Usage
- "Audit our RAG prompt for potential gender or racial bias."
- "Perform an ethics check on this customer support chatbot dataset."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
