# Talent Requirement Generator

This skill helps project leaders build the right human team to complement the AI ecosystem.

## Capabilities

### 1. Gap Analysis
- Evaluates the current codebase and `strategic-roadmap-planner` outputs to find missing technical expertise (e.g., "Need a Rust performance expert").

### 2. Hiring Asset Creation
- Generates tailored Job Descriptions (JDs) focused on the specific needs of the repo.
- Creates relevant coding challenges that mirror actual problems found in the project.

## Usage
- "What kind of engineer should we hire next to accelerate the 3-month roadmap?"
- "Generate a coding challenge for a senior backend candidate based on our recent architectural bottlenecks."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
