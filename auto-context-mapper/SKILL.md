# Auto-Context Mapper

This skill ensures that no task is performed in isolation. It provides "Deep Context" by chaining related data points.

## Capabilities

### 1. Knowledge Chaining
- When a task is started, it identifies related files across `Public`, `Confidential`, and `Personal` tiers.
- Example: If analyzing "AWS Costs," it automatically pulls `kpi_standards.md` and past `budget-variance` reports.

### 2. Prerequisite Gathering
- Automatically prepares the environment by reading necessary design docs or requirements before subsequent skills are triggered by `mission-control`.

## Usage
- "Context-map our current technical debt against the Vision 2030 mission."
- "Prepare the deep context for a multi-year financial simulation."

## Knowledge Protocol
- Adheres to `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md` and `optimization-standards.md`.
