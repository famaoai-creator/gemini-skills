# Performance Monitor Analyst

This skill compares "what we want" (NFR) with "what we have" (Profiling Logs).

## Capabilities

### 1. Profiling Log Analysis
- Reads outputs from `Clinic.js`, `cProfile`, or `chrome://tracing`.
- Identifies heavy functions and memory leaks.

### 2. Gap Analysis
- Compares measured response times (Latency) and other Golden Signals against the targets in `knowledge/nonfunctional/`.
- Evaluates SLO attainment and remaining Error Budget based on [SLO & Dashboard Best Practices](../knowledge/operations/slo_dashboard_best_practices.md).
- Issues "Warning" if targets are missed or if saturation levels are too high.

## Usage
- "Analyze this `profile.json` and tell me if we are meeting our 200ms response time requirement."
- "Where is the bottleneck in this Python profile?"

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
- References [Monitoring Best Practices](../knowledge/operations/monitoring_best_practices.md) for standard performance metrics (Golden Signals).
- References [SLO & Dashboard Best Practices](../knowledge/operations/slo_dashboard_best_practices.md) for service level objectives and error budget analysis.
