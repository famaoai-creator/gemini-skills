# Layout Architect

This skill specializes in **Visual Reverse Engineering**. It analyzes input images or brand guidelines and generates the precise code required to reproduce that design.

## Capabilities

1.  **Slide & Brand Reproduction**:
    - **Image to Marp CSS**: Creates custom themes for Markdown-to-slide conversion.
    - **Brand-to-Theme**: Translates research (colors, logos) into a Marp CSS file in `knowledge/templates/themes/` following the `knowledge/templates/themes/theme_design_guide.md`.
    - **Image to Editable PPTX**: Generates `python-pptx` scripts to build native PowerPoint slides with editable text and shapes.

2.  **UI Reproduction**:
    - **Image to Code**: Converts UI screenshots into HTML/Tailwind, React, or pure CSS.

## Workflow

### 1. Asset Extraction (If input is PPTX)
If the user provides a `.pptx` file instead of an image, first extract the media assets to "see" the design.
```bash
node layout-architect/scripts/extract_images.cjs <path_to_pptx> <output_dir>
```

### 2. Visual Analysis & Theming
Before writing code, analyze the brand assets and define the **Design System**.
- Refer to `knowledge/templates/themes/theme_design_guide.md` for standards on grid layouts and card styles.

## Best Practices
- **Accuracy**: Strive for pixel-perfect layout reproduction.
- **Maintainability**: Use variables/constants for colors and sizes.
