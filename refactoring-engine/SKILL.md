# Refactoring Engine

This skill moves beyond line-by-line changes to perform systemic improvements to the code architecture.

## Capabilities

### 1. Pattern Migration
- Migrates components to new design systems (e.g., from CSS modules to Tailwind, or to Atomic Design).
- Converts legacy syntax to modern standards (e.g., Class components to Functional components in React).

### 2. Dependency Decoupling
- Identifies and breaks circular dependencies.
- Extracts shared logic into centralized services or utilities.

## Usage
- "Refactor all frontend components in `src/` to follow the Atomic Design pattern."
- "Migrate this legacy Python 2.x logic to idiomatic Python 3.12."
