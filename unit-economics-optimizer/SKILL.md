- Identifies "Unprofitable Segments" that are draining resources.

### 2. Pricing & Churn Strategy
- Proposes pricing adjustments based on `cloud-cost-estimator` data and `telemetry-insight-engine` usage patterns.

## Usage
- "Calculate the unit economics for our 'Basic' plan vs. 'Enterprise' plan."
- "How can we improve our LTV/CAC ratio? Analyze the latest churn data."

## Knowledge Protocol
- Adheres to `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`.
- References [IT Cost Benchmarks](../knowledge/economics/it_cost_benchmarks.md) for SaaS/Software sector spending standards.
