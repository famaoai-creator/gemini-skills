# Knowledge Fetcher (Hybrid Bridge)

This skill acts as the gateway to the monorepo's collective intelligence, supporting a tiered access model between public and confidential data.

## Capabilities

### 1. 3-Tier Sovereign Search
Automatically searches for relevant documentation across three tiers:
- **Public Tier**: `knowledge/` (Synced with Git).
- **Confidential Tier**: `knowledge/confidential/` (Company/Client-specific secrets).
- **Personal Tier**: `knowledge/personal/` (Strictly local, machine-specific secrets).

### 2. Multi-Source Consolidation & Precedence
- **Precedence**: Personal > Client-Confidential > General-Confidential > Public.
- Merges findings from both tiers to provide a complete context.
- Prioritizes confidential standards if a conflict exists with public ones (e.g., specific company policies overriding generic ones).

## Usage
- "Fetch all knowledge regarding [Topic], including any internal confidential standards."
- "What is our company's specific policy on [Security Method]? Check the confidential tier."

## Safety
- This skill NEVER outputs the full content of confidential files if it detects a public-facing task (like drafting an issue on GitHub). It provides summarized, safe insights instead.
## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
