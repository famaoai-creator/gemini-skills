# Ecosystem Integration Test

This skill ensures the "Digital Nervous System" is intact.

## Capabilities

### 1. Handover Verification
- Simulates common skill chains (e.g., `RD -> Code`).
- Checks if the JSON output of Skill A matches the input schema of Skill B.

### 2. Protocol Adherence Check
- Verifies that all skills are correctly using `scripts/lib/core.cjs` and following the 3-Tier Knowledge Protocol.

## Usage
- "Run a full integration test on the 'Business Launchpad' meta-skill chain."
- "Verify that `requirements-wizard` outputs can be parsed by `test-suite-architect`."
