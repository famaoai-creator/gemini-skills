# Engineering Culture Analyst

This skill focuses on the "Human" side of software development to ensure team health and psychological safety.

## Capabilities

### 1. Communication Audit
- Analyzes the tone and constructiveness of code review comments (anonymized).
- Identifies "Knowledge Silos" where critical modules are only understood by a single person.

### 2. Burnout Risk Detection
- Detects patterns of excessive late-night commits or long streaks without breaks to warn about potential burnout.

## Usage
- "Analyze our review patterns for potential knowledge silos."
- "Perform an anonymized audit of the communication tone in recent PRs."
