# Doc-Sync Sentinel

This skill ensures that documentation never becomes stale by keeping it in perfect sync with the implementation.

## Capabilities

### 1. Drift Detection
- Analyzes recent commits and compares them against existing documentation (README, internal docs, JSDoc).
- Identifies specific sections that are no longer accurate due to code changes.

### 2. Autonomous Update
- Generates updated documentation text that reflects the current state of the code.
- Can automatically propose PRs to fix documentation drift.

## Usage
- "Check for documentation drift in the `api/` directory and update the relevant README files."
- "Ensure all JSDoc comments in `src/utils` match the current function signatures."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
