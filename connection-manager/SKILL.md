# Connection Manager

This skill is the "Keymaster" of the ecosystem. It centralizes authentication to prevent credential sprawl.

## Capabilities

### 1. Credential Validation
- Checks if required config files exist in `knowledge/personal/connections/`.
- Verifies format correctness (JSON schema check).

### 2. Environment Injection
- Reads the private JSON configs and exports them as environment variables (e.g., `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`) for the duration of the session.

### 3. Connection Diagnostics
- Performs a "Ping" test for configured services to verify that tokens are active and permissions are correct.

## Usage
- "Check my connection status for all configured tools."
- "Inject Slack credentials for the `slack-communicator-pro` skill."

## Knowledge Protocol
- **Strict Confidentiality**: Never outputs actual token values to logs or console. Only reports "Connected" or "Failed".
- Refers to `knowledge/connections/setup_guide.md`.
