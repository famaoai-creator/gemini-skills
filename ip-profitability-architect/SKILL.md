# IP Profitability Architect

This skill turns your proprietary code into a strategic profit engine.

## Capabilities

### 1. Monetization Modeling

- Analyzes patentable code found by `ip-strategist` and proposes licensing models (SaaS, OEM, White-label).
- Estimates potential revenue from opening certain modules as "Commercial SDKs."

### 2. Open-Source Strategy

- Evaluates the business impact of open-sourcing parts of the codebase to build community trust vs. keeping them proprietary for competitive edge.

## Usage

- "How can we monetize our unique order validation algorithm?"
- "Draft a licensing model for our AI-native UI components."

## Knowledge Protocol

- Adheres to `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`.
