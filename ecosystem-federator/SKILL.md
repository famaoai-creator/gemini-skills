# Ecosystem Federator

This skill enables "Agent Diplomacy," allowing this monorepo to communicate and collaborate with other autonomous systems.

## Capabilities

### 1. Cross-Project Negotiation
- Communicates with other agents to align on breaking changes in shared APIs or libraries.
- Automates the "Handshake" process between independent service teams.

### 2. Specification Alignment
- Ensures that local specifications match external standards or partner requirements through automated dialogue.

## Usage
- "Coordinate with the AI agent of the 'Payment-Gateway' repo to align our upcoming schema changes."
- "Negotiate the version update for our shared utility library with the Infrastructure team's agent."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
