# Skill Evolution Engine

This is the self-improvement core of the monorepo. It monitors other skills and updates them based on real-world performance.

## Capabilities

### 1. Failure Analysis
- Inspects `work/` logs to identify why a skill tool call failed or was suboptimal.
- Correlates errors with specific instructions in `SKILL.md`.

### 2. Autonomous Patching
- Generates and applies improvements to `SKILL.md` (instructions) and associated scripts to prevent future errors.
- Proposes architectural changes to skills if the current approach is fundamentally limited.

## Usage
- "Analyze the performance of all skills over the last week and evolve those with high failure rates."
- "The `browser-navigator` keeps failing on SPA sites. Use `skill-evolution-engine` to fix it."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
