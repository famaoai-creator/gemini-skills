# Operational Runbook Generator

This skill ensures that every operational task is documented with professional rigor to prevent human error.

## Capabilities

### 1. Runbook Synthesis
- Translates high-level requests (e.g., "Rotate the DB keys") into a structured Markdown runbook.
- Follows the AI-native guidelines in [Runbook Best Practices](../knowledge/operations/runbook_best_practices.md) (e.g., code blocks, validation steps).

### 2. Risk & Rollback Planning
- Automatically identifies risks associated with the task.
- Generates specific rollback commands for each step as required by the best practices.

## Usage
- "Generate an operational runbook for upgrading our RDS instance from t3.medium to t3.large."
- "Create a procedure for annual SSL certificate rotation."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`.
- References [Runbook Best Practices](../knowledge/operations/runbook_best_practices.md) for generating machine-readable and executable operational procedures.
