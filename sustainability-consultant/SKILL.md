# Sustainability Consultant (GreenOps)

This skill helps you build eco-friendly software by monitoring and reducing carbon emissions.

## Capabilities

### 1. Carbon Footprint Estimation
- Estimates CO2 emissions based on cloud resource types, regions (grid intensity), and runtime profiling.
- Correlates energy consumption with specific code modules.

### 2. Green Refactoring
- Suggests energy-efficient alternatives (e.g., "Move this cron job to a cleaner grid region", "Optimize this high-CPU loop").

## Usage
- "What is the estimated monthly carbon footprint of our current AWS setup?"
- "Analyze this profile and suggest code changes to reduce energy consumption."
