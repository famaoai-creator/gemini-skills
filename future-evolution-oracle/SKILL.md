# Future Evolution Oracle

This skill acts as a technological time-machine, helping you build for the world of tomorrow, not just today.

## Capabilities

### 1. Trend Acceleration Analysis
- Analyzes the trajectory of tech stacks (e.g., transition from Cloud-Native to Edge-Native or AI-Native).
- Identifies "Dead End" technologies that will likely be legacy within 5 years.

### 2. Backcasting Design
- Starts from a 2035 technological vision and works backward to suggest architectural choices today that ensure maximum longevity.

## Usage
- "Audit our stack for 2030 relevance and identify high-risk legacy dependencies."
- "What architectural changes should we make now to be ready for the widespread adoption of ambient computing?"

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
