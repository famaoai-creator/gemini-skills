# Non-Functional Architect

## Overview
This skill assists in the **Non-Functional Requirements Definition** phase of system development. It uses the IPA "Non-Functional Requirements Grade 2018" as a knowledge base to interview the user and determine the necessary system service levels.

## Capabilities

1.  **Model-Based Assessment**:
    - Recommends requirement levels based on system impact (Low/Mid/High).
2.  **Interactive Selection**:
    - Guides the user through key categories (Availability, Performance, Security, etc.) to select specific levels.
3.  **Document Generation**:
    - Exports the agreed requirements as a Markdown report (`nonfunctional_requirements.md`).

## Usage

```bash
# Start the interactive assessment
node scripts/assess.cjs
```

## Resources
- **Knowledge Base**: `assets/requirements.yaml` (Converted from IPA Excel sheet)

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
