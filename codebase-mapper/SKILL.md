Maps the directory structure of the project to help the AI understand the codebase layout.

## Usage

```bash
node codebase-mapper/scripts/map.cjs <directory_path> [max_depth]
```

- `<directory_path>`: Root directory to map (default: `.`)
- `[max_depth]`: How deep to traverse (default: `3`)
## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
