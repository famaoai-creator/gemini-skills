# Biometric & Mood Data Privacy Protocol

The `biometric-context-adapter` processes sensitive behavioral data. This protocol ensures your privacy.

## 1. Data Sovereignty

- All mood inference data is stored in `knowledge/personal/biometrics/`.
- **NEVER** shared with the cloud, the Hive Mind, or Git (even private repos).

## 2. Inference Logic

- **Typing Speed**: Faster than average = Flow/High Energy.
- **Correction Rate**: High backspace/edit rate = Stress/Cognitive Load.
- **Time of Day**: Late night activity = Potential Fatigue.

## 3. The Niko-Niko Calendar

- A visual Markdown table stored locally.
- Used only to provide feedback to the user ("You've been working late for 3 days; consider rest").
