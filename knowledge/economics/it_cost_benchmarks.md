# IT Cost Benchmarks & Strategic ROI

## 1. General Corporate IT Cost Benchmarks (For Financial Analysis)
These metrics represent global and regional industry standards for IT spending.

### 1.1 IT Spending as % of Revenue
| Industry | Standard % | High (Aggressive) | Low (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Technology / SaaS | 7.0 - 9.0% | 15.0% + | 4.0% |
| Financial Services| 6.0 - 8.0% | 10.0% | 3.0% |
| Manufacturing | 1.5 - 2.5% | 4.0% | 1.0% |
| Retail | 2.0 - 3.0% | 5.0% | 1.2% |

### 1.2 Run vs. Change Ratio (Opex vs Capex)
- **Run (Maintenance/Lights on)**: 65% - 75%
- **Change (Innovation/New Development)**: 25% - 35%
- *Goal for Autonomous Systems*: Reduce 'Run' to <50% by automating routine audits and diagnostics.

## 2. Gemini Ecosystem ROI Logic (Tool Efficiency)
How this autonomous system contributes to reducing the "Run" cost.

### 2.1 Cost Assumptions
- **Engineer Hourly Rate**: $100 (Global Enterprise Standard)
- **Manual Overhead**: 20% (Context switching, setup time)

### 2.2 Manual Effort Estimation (Human Baseline)
| Skill Category | Manual Effort (per op) | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Audit/Scan** | 15 mins (900,000ms) | Manual code review, security check, or compliance audit. |
| **Generation** | 30 mins (1,800,000ms) | Drafting docs, slide creation, or scaffolding logic. |
| **Conversion** | 10 mins (600,000ms) | Parsing raw data or converting document formats. |
| **Analysis** | 60 mins (3,600,000ms) | Deep investigation into incidents, logs, or financial drifts. |
| **Default** | 5 mins (300,000ms) | Simple task orchestration or status checks. |

### 2.3 ROI Formula
```
Time Saved = (Manual Effort * Executions) - (AI Execution Time)
Gross Savings = (Time Saved / 3600000) * $100
Direct ROI = (Gross Savings / infrastructure_cost) * 100%
```
*(Currently, AI execution time is measured in ms, making human-equivalent savings almost equal to Gross Savings due to sub-second responses.)*
