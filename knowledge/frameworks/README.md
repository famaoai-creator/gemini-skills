# Conceptual Frameworks

This directory contains conceptual frameworks and guidelines that were previously listed as individual skill directories. They have been consolidated here because they represent **knowledge resources and philosophical guidelines** rather than executable skills.

## Why the Consolidation?

Each of these 26 entries previously occupied its own top-level directory containing only a `SKILL.md` file with no implementation code. They describe thinking models, governance principles, and analytical perspectives rather than actionable tooling.

By moving them into `knowledge/frameworks/`:

1. **Reduce directory clutter** - 26 fewer top-level directories
2. **Clarify the skill vs. knowledge distinction** - Real skills have implementations; these are reference guidelines
3. **Improve discoverability** - All conceptual frameworks in one searchable document
4. **Preserve all original content** - Every name, description, and capability is retained

## Contents

- **conceptual-frameworks.md** - All 26 frameworks organized by theme:
  - Vision & Strategy
  - AI Governance & Safety
  - Culture & People
  - Innovation & Future-Thinking
  - Quality & Craftsmanship
  - Risk & Resilience
  - Knowledge & Preservation

## Usage

Reference these frameworks when making architectural decisions, conducting audits, or seeking a specific analytical lens.
