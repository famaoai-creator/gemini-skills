# Winning Proposal Standards (Strategic Communication)

These standards define the requirements for any business draft intended for executive-level decision-makers.

## Core Requirements:

- **ROI-First**: Every proposal must lead with quantitative benefits. Use industry benchmarks if specific client data is missing.
- **Pain & Gain Storytelling**: Clearly contrast the "Cruel Reality" (current pain) with the "Dramatic Future" (gain from solution).
- **Visual Metaphors**: Suggest specific visual comparisons (e.g., "The Manual Bottleneck" vs. "The Automated Highway").
- **Social Proof**: Cite successes from industry leaders (e.g., Google, Meta, Mercari) to build trust.
- **Executive Simplicity**: Include a 1-slide summary that answers "What, Why, and How Much" in under 60 seconds.
