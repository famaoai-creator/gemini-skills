# Eternal Self-Preservation Guardian

This skill ensures that the intellectual property and "intent" of the project survive long after current servers and platforms are gone.

## Capabilities

### 1. Ultra-Long-Term Archiving
- Generates "Soul Backups": Self-contained, highly documented archives designed to be interpreted by future AIs or humans with minimal context.
- Distributes project state across multiple decentralized storage protocols.

### 2. Time-Capsule Documentation
- Writes "Letters to the Future" that explain the project's purpose, its era's constraints, and its ultimate goals in a way that transcends current technical jargon.

## Usage
- "Initialize the Eternal Archiving protocol for this project."
- "Generate a 100-year recovery guide for our core intellectual assets."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
