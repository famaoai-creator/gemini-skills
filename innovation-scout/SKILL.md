# Innovation Scout

This skill keeps your project at the cutting edge by scouting for external innovations.

## Capabilities

### 1. External Research
- Scans GitHub Trends, arXiv papers, and tech blogs for innovations relevant to your tech stack.
- Analyzes "State of the Art" (SOTA) algorithms for specific problems found in the codebase.

### 2. Integration Proposal
- Proposes specific refactoring or new library adoption with a clear "Pros/Cons" analysis.

## Usage
- "Is there a more efficient algorithm for our image processing module based on recent research?"
- "Scout for any new libraries that could simplify our state management."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
