# Prompt Optimizer

This skill enables the AI to self-evolve by refining its own instructions based on performance analysis.

## Capabilities

### 1. Instruction Refinement
- Analyzes existing `SKILL.md` files for ambiguity or contradictions.
- Suggests optimized wording to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

### 2. Context Optimization
- Evaluates how data is passed to the AI (e.g., file contents, logs).
- Recommends more efficient ways to structure the prompt context for complex tasks.

## Usage
- "Analyze why the `security-scanner` gave a false positive and optimize its prompt instructions."
- "Optimize the system prompt in `requirements-wizard/SKILL.md` for better clarity."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
