# Boilerplate Genie

This skill accelerates project kickoff by generating a robust directory structure and configuration files based on industry standards and the `project-health-check` criteria.

## Capabilities

### 1. Template Generation
- **Web**: Next.js (TS) with Tailwind, Jest, and GitHub Actions.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) or Express (TS) with Docker and Unit Tests.
- **CLI**: Node.js or Python boilerplate with argument parsing.

### 2. Standard Configuration Injection
Automatically adds:
- `.gitignore` (optimized for the stack).
- `README.md` (structured for developers).
- Linting/Formatting configs (ESLint, Prettier, Ruff).
- CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI).

## Usage
- "Scaffold a new Next.js project in `work/my-app` with full CI/CD setup."
- "Create a clean FastAPI boilerplate for a REST API."
