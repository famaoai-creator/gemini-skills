# Boilerplate Genie

This skill accelerates project kickoff by generating a robust directory structure and configuration files based on industry standards and the `project-health-check` criteria.

## Capabilities

### 1. Best-Practice Scaffolding
- Generates project structures for Next.js, Python (FastAPI), Go, etc.
- **Rule Injection**: Automatically copies harvested coding standards (from `knowledge/external-wisdom/everything-claude/rules/`) into the project's `docs/guidelines/` or `.cursorrules`.

### 2. CI/CD & Testing Setup
- Configures GitHub Actions and test runners.

## Usage
- "Scaffold a new Next.js project in `work/my-app` with full CI/CD setup."
- "Create a clean FastAPI boilerplate for a REST API."

## Knowledge Protocol
- This skill adheres to the `knowledge/orchestration/knowledge-protocol.md`. It automatically integrates Public, Confidential (Company/Client), and Personal knowledge tiers, prioritizing the most specific secrets while ensuring no leaks to public outputs.
