# Persona Matrix Switcher

This skill gives the agent "Multiple Minds."

## Capabilities

### 1. Dynamic Roleplay
- Adopts the tone, bias, and priorities of a specific persona defined in `knowledge/personalities/matrix.md`.
- Example: "Act as the Ruthless Auditor" -> The agent becomes critical and risk-averse.

### 2. Debate Simulation
- Simulates a conversation between two conflicting personas (e.g., Inventor vs. CTO).
- Synthesizes the conflict into a "Dialectical Conclusion."

## Usage
- "Debate the risks of our new AI feature from the perspectives of the 'Visionary Inventor' and the 'Ruthless Auditor'."
- "Review this PR as the 'Pragmatic CTO'."

## Knowledge Protocol
- Adheres to `knowledge/personalities/matrix.md`.
